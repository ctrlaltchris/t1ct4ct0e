### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - a game! We'll be making Tic Tac Toe. A game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master!

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be giving you direction. Show us what you've got!

___________________________________________________________________________________

### Goals (Real-World Application)

* Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use problem solving to determine game logic for a simple game
* Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
* Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
* Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
* Have a README.md file that explains your app

___________________________________________________________________________________

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:
* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/cat’s game if neither does
* Have separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Use jQuery and/or pure javascript DOM API for DOM manipulation
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
* Be deployed on a host somewhere where the rest of the world can see it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

___________________________________________________________________________________

### Bonus

These are for extra credit! DON'T focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* Use timers to display "waiting..." messages while users are waiting to be matched
* Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
* Allow game customizable options, time limits, number of cards, board size, game rounds, name & profiles etc  
* Allow players to customize their token (X, O, name, picture, avatar etc)
* Get inventive with your styling ** use CSS effects or animations to spiff things up
* Use **LocalStorage** or **SessionStorage** to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
* Be creative with the game, bend the rules, give it a twist

### EXTRA Bonus

* Connect to a prebuilt backend service for persistence (research **firebase** and try some of their examples)

___________________________________________________________________________________

### Deliverables

* **wireframes**
* README.md file in markdown format explaining the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, etc
* In your README include link to Github repo for your game and show that you've been committing early and often, while utilizing good commit messages.
* In your READMe include link to a hosted version of your game

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class, ask questions when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your game each night
* Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
